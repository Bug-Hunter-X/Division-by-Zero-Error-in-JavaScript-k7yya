# Division by Zero Error in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The error occurs because the function does not check for a zero divisor before attempting division. This leads to a runtime error.

The solution involves adding a check to handle the case where the divisor is zero, preventing the error.
